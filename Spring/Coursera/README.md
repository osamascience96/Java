# Spring Framework Learning

## Important Materials Provided During the Course
> Reference Documentation <br/> https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/reference/html/

## What is Spring?
- A Framework that provides an interface to code and configure the enterprise java-web based application.
- The framework focus on building the architecture of the enterprise application so that the developer focus on the buisness logic of the application.
- A Framework that addresses all tiers of the application.
	- Presentation Layer
	- Buisness Layer
	- Persistence Layer
- The framework is very much flexible in managing the core spring java classes and configuration files that provides us the protable features in any part of the application where required.
	- Rest Services
	- persistence
	- Security

## Advantages
- It is an open source java framework
- Some other technologies that existed before spring are like Persistance Frameworks, Logging Frameworks, and Web Services Frameworks, to which this spring framework utilizes and produce efficient results.
- It has its own Testing Facility to test our code on different input data.
- Every core class of spring framework and other configurations in the framework has the reuseability factor which makes it even more flexible framework to work on spring boot framework.
- It allows us to focus more on the buisness logic and less on the building side of the webs application, it peristance performace etc. 
- We may build some classes that may leaks object data when in the runtmie, so it removes these common issues or else warns us about the leakage of data when used.
- Although there are way more than 50 or 60 design patterns being used worldwide to solve specific problems in the buisness, but it has some build in design patterns which proved to be best for our work.
- The configurations acts as the meta data where when any controller is made, it is made accessible to the whole appliction using the configuration management and then its meta data is used everywhere.
- It provides us abstraction when calling different data access layer and remote calling in the server or any template.


## Dependency Management
- The Framework will create auto instances for you when in need any place in the web application.
- The Classes and Interface dependency is managed by the framework. All POJOs and other Java Critical Classes(Performing Operations on Architecture) data is collaborated by the spring architecture.
- In any part of the application we don't have to instanciate any of the class, it just do that for us using the dependency injection of the Spring Core Packages.
