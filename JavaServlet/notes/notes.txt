JSP and its tags

1: Directive Tag
	<%@page import = "java.util.Date, java.util.animation" %>

2: Declaration Tag
	<%! int value = 1; %>

3: scriptlet Tag
	<% 
		// All logic goes here
	%>
4: expression tag
	<%= result %>

All the tags will be converted to the Servlet which is the container in TOMCAT and the tags above will be placed inside the servlet in the following ways:

	1) importing all the utils or libraries inside the servlet outside the class
	2) init the variables outside all the methods, but inside the main class
	3) The scriptable tag enters all the logic inside main servlet method "service" that executes the main logic when data is send thorugh any method 
	   type.
	4) The expression tag can be placed inside any of the page tags that will translate the value of the variable to the design params.




The Directive tag has some of the attributes
 page: what you want to specify for this jsp page.
 language: which language, by default it's java, not mandatory to add this attribute.
 extends: which class you want to inherit to your servlet.
 import: to import any package to the servlet, we can also add the multiple.
 session: true|false [Do you want any session in your JSP]
 autoFlush: if you have set the buffersize and when outputing the response, the buffer may sometimes overflow, so for that you can specify 2 values true|false.
 contenttype: The content type specifies the content of the page that is being send the client.
 errorpage: The error page specifies the exception handling that you want to handle on the page
 isErrorpage: is this the JSP where the page is expected to be handled or is this the error page
 
The servlet object can be used explicitly with the JSP object thus if you want to perform any operation that contains server side processing to fetching 
the data from the database or perform fetching anyting from the API etc.
